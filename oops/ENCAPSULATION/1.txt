wrapping up data member nd functions into a single entity is called encapsulation
fully encapsulated class: all data members are private(same class me hi access kar sakte directly)
ADV:
ENCAPSULATION is information/data hiding therefore security increases
code resuability
class can be read only (if only getter is given and no setter)
unit testing manageable
