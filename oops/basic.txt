Q.what is oop?
-> a type of programming paradign which revolves around object, 
,bringing my program close to real world so my code becomes more manageable, reusable, readability.
object?
->an entity which has state or property and behaviour. eg:laptop
eg: u are playing  game, usme ek character is hero:
he has a name, health and levels ,hero also has behaviour traits: dancing, defense,attack etc
->CLASS:user defined data-type, object is an instance of class
code:
class Hero{

public:    
char name[100];
int health;
int level;

void print()
{
    cout<<"level"<<level;
}


};

int main()
{
    Hero soham;  //object of class hero , object takes size based on properties in class.
    cout<<"health is "<<soham.health<<endl;   //to acess properties of class
    soham.health=70;
    soham.level='A'; //to put value
    
    return 0;
}


//object in short is astitva of class it gives value to the template//class is a template
//if empty class and no properties, toh size should be 0, but it prints 1 byte
//obj is given 1 byte of memory
//if u wanna include a class in alag file, u can include it using : #include"class_name.cpp" in header
