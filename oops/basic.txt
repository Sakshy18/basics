Q.what is oop?
-> a type of programming paradign which revolves around object, 
,bringing my program close to real world so my code becomes more manageable, reusable, readability.
object?
->an entity which has state or property and behaviour. eg:laptop
eg: u are playing  game, usme ek character is hero:
he has a name, health and levels ,hero also has behaviour traits: dancing, defense,attack etc
->CLASS:user defined data-type, object is an instance of class
code:
class Hero{

public:    
char name[100];
int health;
int level;

void print()
{
    cout<<"level"<<level;
}


};

int main()
{
    Hero soham;  //object of class hero , object takes size based on properties in class.
    cout<<"health is "<<soham.health<<endl;   //to acess properties of class
    soham.health=70;
    soham.level='A'; //to put value
    
    return 0;
}


//object in short is astitva of class it gives value to the template//class is a template
//if empty class and no properties, toh size should be 0, but it prints 1 byte
//obj is given 1 byte of memory
//if u wanna include a class in alag file, u can include it using : #include"class_name.cpp" in header

GETTER & SETTER
getter is for fetching,setter can be used to put some conditions also like if else etc
function inside class which can be used to access pribvate mmebers of class;
class Hero{

private:    
int health;

public:
int level;

char gethealth()
{
    return health;
}

void sethealth(int h)
{
    health=h; //setting h 
}

};

int main()
{
    Hero soham;   //instantiating an object 
    Hero ramesh;  //static allocation
   Hero * mahesh= new Hero;  //dynamic memory allocation
   //mahesh pointing to hero type in heap memory 
    cout<<"level is"<<(*mahesh).level<<endl;
     cout<<"level is"<<(*mahesh).gethealth()<<endl;
    //sirf b is address obj is at adddress so we just referenced it using pointer *mahesh isiliye
    //mahesh->gethealth() is an alternative to the same


    ramesh.sethealth(70);
    soham.level='A'; //as it was public it can be fetched dirrectly
    cout<<"health is "<<soham.health<<endl;  //since health is private it cant be accessed directtly
    //to access health we have to use getters and setters
    //now as we used  getter we ecan access directtly
    cout<<ramesh.gethealth()<<endl;  //output will be 70

    return 0;
}
//padding and greedy allignment readability
